The average answer for question #2 was 2.1, while the average answer for question #3 was
3.6. This means that survey takers would split groceries more often if there was an app
like ours.

The majority of those surveyed stated that they have difficulties tracking grocery costs. Of those who have roomates or housemates, **89.9%** replied "Yes" to the question, *Do you sometimes have difficulties keeping track of who needs to pay for what?*

## Observation 3 - Chace Carey

In response to the question *Do you currently use any apps to help you divide grocery costs?* **100%** of responses said "No". This tells us that there is no competion to our app that is known, giving it unique value.

When asked how important it was that cost was split evenly between roommates **47.1%** said that it was important. This response shows that most people who live with someone want the cost to be split equally.
