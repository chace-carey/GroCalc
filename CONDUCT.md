# Code of Conduct

## Desicions

Desicions will be made democratically, that is, majority vote.

## Attendance

Everyone should try their best to show up and be on time. If someone can't make a meeting,
they should contact the team's groupchat beforehand and provide a reason for their absence.
If the a member of the team finds the reason for absence unreasonable, then they should bring
it up, either in the team groupchat or at a meeting, and the team will discuss it together and
figure it out.

## Assignments

People will choose what things they would like to work on. During meeting we will also breakdown
user stories into tasks, and then using the kanban board, we can assign members to the tasks. 
For most problems that come up within the group, including doing poorly on assignments, we will 
discuss as a group in order to promote communication and the democratic princple of desicion making.

## Participation

Everyone should partcipate to their best ability. Again, if members of the group do not think another
member is contributing enough, we will bring it up without hesitation and discuss how we should go 
about it as a group.

## Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums

We have set up a groupchat over iMessage for our main line of communication. We will plan to 
at least messsage the group once a week, and we are going to set up group meetings as needed, 
in addition to the meetings in class.

## Agenda and Minutes/Notes

We will decide a person to take notes each day as of now; however, if someone in the group seems
to take better notes or wants to be primary note taker, then we will decide as a group how to go
about this.

## Promptness

We are all pretty lenient with tardiness, as of now. The only thing we ask group members is to 
message the groupchat before the meeting time if you think you will be late. If one member seems
to show up late everytime and it is a problem for some group members, then we will, again, make 
desicions about this as a group when the problem arises.

## Conversational Courtesy

Everyone should be respectful with any criticism or problems expressed to group members.

## Enforcement/Feedback

Again, as with everything else, our group will decide how to enforce these rules as group 
when a problem arises. We feel that our group should be able to bring up problems with each
other whenever they arise, and then be able to work out these problems through conversation.
We encourage people to bring up problems with each other and commend group members when they
did a good job.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

In order to make sure everyone feels included and safe within our group, our team will make sure
to reach out to team members that don't seem to be contributing or seem timid while contributing
to ensure this person knows they are welcome and apperciated. Or, if someone feels as if one
person is starting to discriminate, isolate, or overpower one of the members of the group, then
we encourage that person to call it out within group discussions in order to solve the problem
and not allow it to linger.
