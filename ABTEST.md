## A/B Test Name: Ad revenue
## User Story Number: User Story #5
## Metric: Task Success


## Hypothesis:
For this test we want users to be able to input their roommates names in an easy and concise way that allows them to divide the cost among themselves with accurate and fast answers.
For this we want to make sure there is no confusion in where to add names as well as no incorrect answers and dividing the cost among a specified amount of people. 
Some bottlenecks noticed was user not being able find the add names button as it was fairly vague in what it did. One idea was to have an add names label next to the button or 
formatting the button name to “add names”. Our success criteria would be as soon as users enter onto the add names pages they immediately know where to add 
names this can be proven by seeing how long people spend on the specific page before hitting the add names button. And trying to lower the time for each user visited.


## Experiment: 
For our experiment we will first try out a bigger button with an “add names” title on it for all users. 
This would be our first experiment as it may be a sight issue in our app. Since they are already looking at a small device a bigger button may be easier to see. 
To view these metric we will time how long they are on that specific screen and see if times go down while on that screen which will indicate they bigger button size is working.


## Variations: 
Some variations we would like to test is a label of “add names” next to a “+” button that can reduce screen real estate as a big button won't be blocking the screen. 
Another idea is just a simple “+” button on the screen with a header saying “Add names”
