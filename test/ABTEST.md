## A/B Test Name: Ease Of Use
## User Story Number: User Story #5
## Metric: Task Success


## Hypothesis:
For this test we want users to be able to input their roommates names in an easy and concise way that allows them to divide the cost among themselves with accurate and fast answers.
For this we want to make sure there is no confusion in where to add names as well as no incorrect answers and dividing the cost among a specified amount of people. 
Some bottlenecks noticed was user not being able find the add names button as it was fairly vague in what it did. One idea was to have an add names label next to the button or 
formatting the button name to “add names”. Our success criteria would be as soon as users enter onto the add names pages they immediately know where to add 
names this can be proven by seeing how long people spend on the specific page before hitting the add names button. And trying to lower the time for each user visited.


## Experiment: 
For our experiment we will first try out a bigger button with an “add names” title on it for all users. 
This would be our first experiment as it may be a sight issue in our app. Since they are already looking at a small device a bigger button may be easier to see. 
To view these metric we will time how long they are on that specific screen and see if times go down while on that screen which will indicate they bigger button size is working.


## Variations: 
Some variations we would like to test is a label of “add names” next to a “+” button that can reduce screen real estate as a big button won't be blocking the screen. 
Another idea is just a simple “+” button on the screen with a header saying “Add names”

## A/B Test Name: User Contentment
## User Story Number: User Story #7
## Metric: Happiness

## Hypothesis:
For this test, we want a group of test users to use the features added in this user story and then take a survey on whether they enjoyed it and what could be changed.
With this, we want to make sure users are happy and content with how our app performs and also get user feedback on what we could do to improve their experience. 
We expect some bottlenecks to be the ease at which users can add roomates and items, as well as how accessible navigating the site is. An idea for this is to make
common household items appear on a drop down menu when a user presses on "Add Item." This way users won't have to waste too much time inputting a custom item for
their whole grocery list. As such, we expect the user contentment to be greater if we were to implement this.


## Experiment: 
We will get a group of 8-10 people to test out our app. For the first group, Group A, when they click the "Add Item" button in order to start their grocery list, a checkbox
drop-down menu will appear with common household items that they can check off to automatically put them in their list (e.g., Milk, Eggs, Bread, Toilet Paper, etc..>.
For the second group, Group B, we will have them input all of their grocery items into their list manually. During this, we will see how much time users spend setting 
up their list by tracking the amount of time they spend on the site. Then, after they have completed their list, we will ask them to take a survey detailing
how enjoyable the experience was for them and where we could improve our app. We will then compare the results to see if group A rated their experience as more enjoyable
than group B.


## Variations: 
The variations for this is just going to be the drop-down menu of common household items for Group A and then no additional feature for Group B.
